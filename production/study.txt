Small talk 
 I hate small talk. I want to talk about atoms, death, aliens, sex, magic, intellect, the meaning of life, faraway galaxies, music that makes you feel different, memories, the lies you’ve told, your flaws, your favorite scents, your childhood, 
what keeps you up at night, your insecurities and fears. I like people with depth, 
who speak with emotion from a twisted mind.

From Google search I hate small talk 
Some introverts hate small talk because they're shy and talking with people they don't know makes them feel uncomfortable. Others simply prefer to be alone and find social interactions mentally draining. Introverts also tend to enjoy deeper conversations more. 7 So, small talk might not stimulate them mentally
